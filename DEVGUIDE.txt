Server part: django
-------------------

Dependencies:
- Python
- Django + proper database configuration
- Pillow
- Imagemagick available from the PATH
- pytz
- South (to help you upgrade your database when needed)
- mod_wsgi + Apache

Create a server/settings module (you can copy server/settings_example) and edit
with your own settings (database, location of your pictures, etc.).
Authenticated users are required to use webgallery, so you need to put in place
authentication.

Client part: gwt
----------------

Install gwt sdk
Make sure you have ant
Edit client/build.xml to reflect your installation of gwt (edit property
 gwt.sdk)

$ cd client
$ ant build

Running from Eclipse:

Click on the arrow next to the 'Run' icon, select "Run configurations"

1- Main: project "WebGallery", Main class "com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode"
2- Server: unselect "Run built-in server"
3- GWT: URL set either "http://localhost:8000/" if you're using manage.py to run
   the server, or use "http://localhost/" if you're having a locally hosted
   server, or use any address/port according to the way you launch the
   django server.
4- Arguments: VM arguments, add "-Dgwt.persistentunitcachedir=build" so that
   useless temporary files are all located to the same build directory, ignored
   by git (so will never be committed).

You can now click 'Run'
